## Project Description
This repository hosts research and prototype development for **“Toward Climate-Resilient Energy Systems: A Geospatial RAG-Enabled Digital Twin Approach for Equity and Ecosystem Sustainability.”**  

The project integrates **machine learning, geospatial intelligence (GIS), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to strengthen smart power grids in wildfire-prone regions like California. Unlike conventional outage forecasting tools, this work overlays outage predictions with **climate hazards (wildfire, drought, extreme heat), ecological data (biodiversity hotspots), and social determinants (environmental justice metrics)** to build a **holistic resilience framework**.  

Key contributions include:  
- **Wildfire–Outage Risk Modeling:** Comparative ML analysis (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict power outages and ignition events.  
- **Geospatial Integration:** Spatial overlays of wildfire zones, biodiversity, and grid infrastructure for resilience planning.  
- **Digital Twin Development:** A prototype decision-support tool combining real-time outage forecasts with ecological and community vulnerability insights.  
- **Equity & Sustainability:** Ensuring that climate resilience solutions prioritize vulnerable populations while balancing ecosystem sustainability.  

This work contributes to the **CASPER program at Meharry Medical College** and is being prepared for academic publication, policy applications, and future stakeholder workshops.

## Problem Statement & Solution
**Problem:**  
California’s increasing wildfire activity, drought, and extreme heat have destabilized the state’s power grid. While AI platforms can forecast outages, they rarely integrate environmental and ecological data critical for **holistic resilience planning**.  

**Solution:**  
Develop a **GIS- and AI-enabled overlay system** that merges:  
- Real-time power outage forecasts  
- Wildfire ignition zones  
- Biodiversity hotspots  
- Environmental justice metrics  

This approach empowers **utilities, planners, and policymakers** with smarter, greener, and more equitable decision-making tools.

## Executive Summary
Open Access Technology International (OATI) launched the **world’s first generative & agentic AI platform** for the energy industry—**OATI Genie™**—through a pilot with CAISO [OATI, 2023].  

California leads in AI-enabled smart grid adoption (CEC, 2022; CalFire, 2023). Yet, **forecasting alone is insufficient**—wildfires, heat, and drought worsen grid vulnerabilities.  

This project advances a **RAG + GIS + AI digital twin framework**, integrating ecological and climate data with outage predictions for **smarter energy resilience**.
