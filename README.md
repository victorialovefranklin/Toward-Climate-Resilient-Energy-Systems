## Project Overview
This repository hosts research and prototype development for **‚ÄúToward Climate-Resilient Energy Systems: A Geospatial RAG-Enabled Digital Twin Approach for Equity and Ecosystem Sustainability.‚Äù**  

The project integrates:
- **Machine Learning (ML)**
- **Geospatial Intelligence (GIS)**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  

to strengthen **smart power-grid resilience** in wildfire-prone regions such as California.  
Unlike conventional outage-forecasting tools, this project overlays outage predictions with:  
- Climate hazards (*wildfire, drought, extreme heat*)  
- Ecological data (*biodiversity hotspots*)  
- Social determinants (*environmental justice metrics*)  

to build a **holistic resilience framework**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contributions
- **Wildfire‚ÄìOutage Risk Modeling** ‚Äî Comparative ML (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict outages and ignition events.  
- **Geospatial Integration** ‚Äî Spatial overlays of wildfire zones, biodiversity, and grid infrastructure for resilience planning.  
- **Digital Twin Prototype** ‚Äî Decision-support tool combining real-time forecasts with ecological and community vulnerability data.  
- **Equity & Sustainability** ‚Äî Ensures climate resilience strategies prioritize vulnerable communities and protect ecosystems.  

This research supports the **CASPER Lab** and contributes to future **academic publications, policy briefs, and stakeholder workshops**.

## üß© Problem Statement & Solution

### **Problem**
California‚Äôs increasing **wildfires, droughts, and extreme heat** have destabilized the state‚Äôs electrical grid.  
Existing AI forecasting systems rarely integrate **ecological** or **equity-based** data necessary for **holistic resilience planning**.

### **Solution**
Develop a **GIS- and AI-enabled overlay system** that merges:
- Real-time power outage forecasts  
- Wildfire ignition zones  
- Biodiversity hotspots  
- Environmental justice metrics  

This empowers **utilities, planners, and policymakers** with smarter, greener, and more equitable decision-making tools.

## üìÑ Executive Summary
Open Access Technology International (OATI) introduced the **first generative and agentic AI platform for the energy sector ‚Äî OATI Genie‚Ñ¢** ‚Äî in partnership with CAISO (OATI, 2023).  

California leads in **AI-driven smart-grid adoption** (CEC, 2022; CalFire, 2023).  
However, **forecasting alone is insufficient**‚Äîwildfires, drought, and heatwaves amplify grid vulnerability.  

This project advances a **RAG + GIS + AI digital-twin framework**, integrating **ecological, climate, and infrastructure data** with outage predictions for **smarter, data-driven energy resilience**.

## üß≠ Scope of Work
- **Develop:** A GIS-based decision-support tool for climate-resilient grids.  
- **Overlay:** Outage and infrastructure layers with:  
  - Wildfire zones  
  - Floodplains  
  - Biodiversity hotspots  
  - Environmental justice indicators  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Coded prototype (Python / Streamlit / Dash)  
  - LaTeX research report  
  - Presentation slides  
  - Peer-reviewed manuscript  

### **Phase 1 ‚Äî Wildfire‚ÄìOutage Integration**
1. Integrate **California wildfire and outage datasets (EAGLE-I, CAL FIRE, CAISO)**.  
2. Identify **key predictors**: wind speed, temperature extremes, drought index.  
3. Detect **outlier events** using Isolation Forest / DBSCAN for resilience calibration.  
4. Rank the **Top 5 High-Risk Counties**.  
5. Perform a **7-day rolling wildfire‚Äìoutage risk analysis**.
