# Part I: Toward Climate-Resilient Energy Systems  
### A Geospatial RAG-Enabled Digital Twin Framework

---

## Abstract
Climate change is intensifying threats to energy security through cascading hazards‚Äîwildfires, extreme temperatures, and grid failures‚Äîthat destabilize critical infrastructure and disproportionately harm marginalized communities.  
This research introduces an integrated framework combining **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to create a comprehensive **geospatial digital twin** of energy networks, prioritizing both **social equity** and **environmental stewardship**.

The framework synthesizes multi-layered datasets‚Äîmeteorological patterns, socioeconomic vulnerabilities, infrastructure conditions, and ecological indicators‚Äîto enable predictive analytics and scenario modeling for proactive climate adaptation.  
RAG delivers interpretable, context-aware AI recommendations that empower decision-makers with transparent reasoning and actionable insights.

California serves as the primary validation environment. Recent wildfire seasons and heat-dome events have exposed grid vulnerabilities and inequities across socioeconomic lines. The digital-twin model demonstrates the ability to identify at-risk populations, enhance resource-deployment efficiency, and reconcile human-welfare and ecological priorities.

## Purpose
To design a **replicable, equity-centered analytical framework** that integrates spatial, environmental, and social data into one intelligent digital-twin architecture for:
- Predicting and mitigating energy disruptions
- Supporting climate-adaptation decisions
- Ensuring equitable energy access across diverse communities

---

## Theoretical Foundation
1. **Socio-Technical Resilience:** Energy security as both a technical and social system requiring adaptive feedback loops.  
2. **Environmental Justice:** Embedding SVI and housing vulnerability ensures marginalized groups are visible in resilience planning.  
3. **Systems Thinking:** Integrating physical (grid + climate) and human (equity + policy) subsystems into one geospatial decision layer.  
4. **Transparent AI:** Using RAG for explainability, grounding AI reasoning in validated geospatial evidence.

## Framework Architecture
**Core Components**
- **Data Layer:** Multi-source integration (EAGLE-I, PSPS, real-time outages, weather, SVI, housing).  
- **AI + Analytics Layer:** Machine-learning forecasting, anomaly detection, SHAP interpretability.  
- **RAG Layer:** Retrieval-based knowledge augmentation for natural-language reasoning and scenario interpretation.  
- **Visualization / GIS Layer:** Interactive digital-twin dashboards for spatial insight and decision support.

**Analytical Pipeline**

## Research Questions
1. How can GIS-AI-RAG integration improve the prediction and explanation of cascading grid failures?  
2. What spatial correlations exist between outage frequency, wildfire/temperature anomalies, and social vulnerability?  
3. How can interpretable AI help policymakers prioritize equitable resilience investments?
