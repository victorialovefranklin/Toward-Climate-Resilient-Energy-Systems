### Overview
The **Cal OES Statewide Power Outages (View)** layer aggregates real-time outage information directly from California’s major utility public outage maps.  
It provides **current, not historical**, statewide outage visibility and supports emergency-operations dashboards.

#### Included Utilities
- **Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)**  
- **Southern California Edison (SCE)**  
- **San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E)**  
- **Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD)**

### Layers
| **Layer Name** | **Geometry Type** | **Description / Use** |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Power Outage Incidents** | Point | Individual outage points from all utilities — shows approximate outage locations and drives dashboard totals. |
| **Power Outage Areas** | Polygon | Rough outage polygons from **PG&E only** — visually indicates affected zones; limited positional accuracy. |
| **Power Outages by County** | Polygon (summarized) | County-level aggregation of impacted customers; ideal for statewide visualization and analytics. |

### ⚙️ Purpose
Developed by Cal OES under the **Emergency Support Function 12 (ESF-12)** program to provide  
real-time situational awareness of statewide power disruptions for emergency-management partners.

---

### ⚠️ Limitations
- **No historical archive.** Represents *only* the most recent outage snapshot at any given time.  
- **Accuracy varies by utility.** PG&E polygon data is approximate; other utilities report only point data.  
- **Operational use only.** Intended for awareness, not for certified counts of affected customers.  
- **Continuous updates.** Each refresh overwrites the previous feed; researchers must log or cache data for time-series analysis.

### 📍 Spatial Domain
- **Extent:** California statewide (≈ 31.69° N – 42.61° N, –125.18° W – –113.63° W)  
- **Coordinate System:** WGS 84  
- **Bounding Counties:** All 58 California counties

### 🔍 Analytical Relevance (for EAGLE-I Cross-Reference)
- Provides **real-time incident visibility** (current outages only) to complement EAGLE-I’s **15-minute time-series archives**.  
- Enables **county-level validation** of active outage magnitudes against EAGLE-I `customers_out` values.  
- Because it lacks historical retention, analysts must **capture snapshots or use streaming APIs** for longitudinal comparison.
