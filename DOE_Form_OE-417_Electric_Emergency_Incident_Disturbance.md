# What DOE Form OE-417 Is  
**‚ÄúElectric Emergency Incident and Disturbance Report‚Äù**

---

## Full Name & Agency
**Form Name:** Electric Emergency Incident and Disturbance Report  
**Agency:** U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) ‚Äî *Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER)*  

---

## Purpose & Legal Basis
Form **DOE-417** is the official **federal reporting form** used by electric utilities, balancing authorities, and reliability coordinators to report **significant electric emergencies, disturbances, or disruptions** in the U.S. bulk power system.

- **Required under:** *Public Law 93-275 (Federal Energy Administration Act)*  
- **Purpose:** To collect standardized data on electric emergencies that can affect **grid reliability**, **national security**, or **critical infrastructure integrity**.  
- **Web Portal:** [doe417.pnnl.gov](https://doe417.pnnl.gov)  
- **Regulatory Guidance:** [RegInfo.gov](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/DownloadDocument?objectID=52749301)

DOE uses these reports to **monitor, analyze, and respond** to grid disruptions and support **legislative, regulatory, or emergency investigations**.

**Reporting Timelines**
| Severity | Filing Deadline |
|-----------|----------------|
| Emergency Alert | Within 1 hour |
| Follow-up / Update | Within 6 hours or next business day |
| Final Report | Within 72 hours |

**In short:** DOE-417 is the **national system for tracking major power outages, emergencies, and disturbances** that could impact reliability or public safety.

## What the Form Tracks

| **Category** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Event date/time** | When the outage or disturbance began and was restored |
| **Event type** | e.g., Emergency, Physical Attack, Cyber Event, Fuel Supply Issue, Severe Weather |
| **Cause** | Direct cause such as equipment failure, natural hazard, vandalism, or safety de-energization |
| **Customers affected** | Number of customers or load (MW) impacted |
| **Duration** | Length of the outage/restoration time |
| **Area(s) affected** | Geographic extent ‚Äî county, state, balancing area |
| **Reporting entity** | Utility, ISO, or Balancing Authority submitting the form |

## Event Classifications (Typical Categories)

| **Code** | **Category** | **Example** |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **E1** | System Physical Attack | Sabotage or vandalism on substations |
| **E2** | Cyber Event | Malware or system compromise |
| **E3** | Fuel Supply Emergency | Natural gas shortage affecting power generation |
| **E4** | Severe Weather / Natural Hazard | Hurricane, wildfire, ice storm, flood, heat wave |
| **E5** | Equipment Failure | Transformer explosion, transmission fault |
| **E6** | Demand / Generation Imbalance | Blackouts or brownouts due to overloading |
| **E7** | Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) / Emergency De-Energization | Utility wildfire-risk shutoffs (if reported federally) |
| **E8** | Operator Error / Procedural Error | Accidental outage or control-room fault |

---

## How the Data Are Used

| **User / Agency** | **Purpose** |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **DOE / FEMA / DHS** | Situational awareness and emergency coordination |
| **EIA & NERC** | Reliability statistics, resilience, and trend analysis |
| **Researchers / Universities** | Outage-cause modeling, vulnerability and climate correlation |
| **State & Utility Agencies** | Benchmarking, linking PSPS to national reporting standards |

## Relation to California PSPS / Smart-Grid Studies

DOE-417 data are highly relevant for:
- **Validating unplanned outages** in the *EAGLE-I* dataset  
- **Classifying outage causes** (e.g., *Severe Weather*, *Equipment Failure*, *Physical Attack*)  
- **Linking state incidents** (Cal OES / CPUC Rollup) to federal outage records  
- **Modeling cascading or multi-hazard events** across regions

## In Simple Terms
The **DOE-417 form** is how electric utilities officially tell the U.S. government **when, where, and why major power outages happen** ‚Äî whether from storms, wildfires, cyberattacks, or equipment failures.  
It serves as the **national logbook of significant power disruptions**, helping the DOE and partners **protect, analyze, and strengthen** the nation‚Äôs electric grid.
